            <h1>What are the symptoms of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection?</h1>
            <p>The CDC says you may have coronavirus if you have these symptoms or combination of symptoms:
              <ul>
                <li> Fever or chills.</li>
                <li> Cough.</li>
                <li> Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.</li>

                <li>Tiredness</li>
                <li> Muscle or body aches.</li>

                <li>Headaches</li>
                <li> Sore throat.</li>

                <li> New loss of taste or smell.</li>
                <li> Congestion or runny nose.</li>
                <li>Nausea or vomiting.</li>
                <li>Additional symptoms are possible.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Symptoms may appear between two and 14 days after exposure to the virus. Children have similar, but
                usually milder, symptoms than adults. Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical
                conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes are at higher risk of more serious complication from
                COVID-19.</h4>

            <h1>How is coronavirus diagnosed?</h1>
            <h4>COVID-19 is diagnosed with a laboratory test. Your healthcare provider may collect a sample of your
              saliva or swab your nose or throat to send for testing.</h4>

            <h2> When should I be tested for the coronavirus (COVID-19)?
              Call your healthcare provider if you:</h2>

            <p> Feel sick with fever, cough or have difficulty breathing.
              <br> Have been in close contact with a person known or suspected to have COVID-19.
              <br> Your healthcare provider will ask you questions about your symptoms. Your healthcare provider will
              tell you if you need to be tested for the novel coronavirus, COVID-19 and where to go to be tested.
            </p>
            <h2>If I have a positive test for coronavirus, how long should I self-isolate?</h2>
            <p>According to current CDC recommendations, you should self-isolate until you've met all three of the
              following criteria:


              <br> It's been 10 days since your symptoms first appeared.
              <br> You've not had a fever for 24 hours and you've not used fever-lowing medications during this time.
              <br> Your COVID-19 symptoms have improved.</p>
            <h2>How long do I need to isolate myself if I’ve been around a person with COVID-19?</h2>
            <p> According to the CDC, if you’ve been in close contact with a person who has COVID-19, your safest
              strategy is to stay home for 14 days after you’ve last seen this person.</p>

            <h2> What medications are currently approved to treat COVID-19?</h2>
            <p> Currently, only one drug has received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Remdesivir (Veklury®)
              is approved to treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection.</p>

            <h2> What treatments do people receive if they have COVID-19?</h2>
            <p> One authoritative organization – The National Institutes of Health COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel –
              recommends the following treatments based on the severity of COVID-19.

              If you’re not in the hospital or don’t need supplemental oxygen:

              No specific antiviral or immunotherapy is recommended.</p>
            <h3> If you’re in the hospital:</h3>

            <p> You may be given IV remdesivir with or without the oral (by mouth) corticosteroid dexamethasone (or
              other steroid) or dexamethasone alone if remdesivir can’t be used.
              <br> Depending on the severity of your COVID infection, you may need:
              <br> Supplemental oxygen (given through tubing inserted into your nostrils).
              <br> Mechanical ventilation (receive oxygen through a tube inserted down your trachea). You are given
              medications to keep you comfortable and sleepy as long as you’re receiving oxygen through a ventilator.
              <br> Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). You continue to receive treatment while a machine pumps
              your blood outside your body. It takes over the function of your body’s lungs and heart.

            <h2> How can I prevent getting the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)?</h2>
            <p> Right now, the best defense to prevent getting COVID-19 is to follow some of the same steps you would
              take
              to prevent getting other viruses, such as the common cold or the flu.


              <br> Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds— especially before eating and preparing food, after using the
              bathroom, after wiping your nose, and after coming in contact with someone who has a cold.
              <br> Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth to prevent the spread of viruses from your hands.
              <br> Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when sneezing and coughing or sneeze and cough into your
              sleeve.
              <br> Throw the tissue in the trash. Wash your hands afterward. Never cough or sneeze into your hands!
              <br> Avoid close contact (within six feet) with those who have coughs, colds or are sick. Stay home if you
              are
              sick.
              <br> If you are prone to sickness or have a weakened immune system, stay away from large crowds of people.
              <br>Follow
              the directions of your healthcare authorities especially during outbreaks.
              <br> Clean frequently used surfaces (such as doorknobs and counter tops) with a virus-killing
              disinfectant.
              <br><br> Use hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
              <br> Greet people with a friendly gesture instead of shaking hands.
              <br> Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet, drink plenty of liquids and exercise if you are able. These
              steps will
              <br> strengthen your immune system and enable you to fight off infections easier.</p>

            <h2> 1. Spraying chlorine or alcohol on the skin kills viruses in the body</h2>
            <p> Applying alcohol or chlorine to the skin can cause harm, especially if it enters the eyes or mouth.
              These chemicals can disinfect surfaces, but people should not use them on their bodies.

              Also, these products cannot kill viruses inside the body.</p>
            <h2>2. Everyone with COVID-19 dies </h2>
            <p> This is false. As we explain above, COVID-19 is fatal for a small percentage of people who develop the
              illness.

              <br> The WHO have reported that around 80%Trusted Source of people with COVID-19 experience a relatively
              form of the illness and do not need specialist treatment in a hospital. Mild symptoms may include a fever,
              a cough, a sore throat, tiredness, and shortness of breath.

              <br> Also, many people with the underlying infection experience no symptoms.</p>
            <h2>3. You have to be with someone for 10 minutes to catch the virus </h2>
            <p> The longer a person is close to someone with the infection, the likelier the virus is to transmit.
              However, the virus can pass from person to person in under 10 minutes.</p>
              <h2>4. The virus will die off when temperatures rise </h2>
               <p> Some viruses, such as cold and flu viruses, spread more easily in colder months. This does not mean that their transmission stops in warmer weather.
                
              <br>  As it stands, scientists do not knowTrusted Source how temperature changes influence the behavior of SARS-CoV-2. </p>
             <h2> 5. The outbreak began because people ate bat soup </h2>
  <p>While scientists are confident that the virus started in animals, there is no evidence that soup was involved. </p>
